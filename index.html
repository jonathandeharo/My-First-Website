    <h1>My First Website!</h1>
    <p>Journal Entry January 7th 2023</p>
    <p>I have only really learn C++ and Java in college
      but I am excited to teach myself web development alongside
      the theory heavy content I am learning at UC Davis.
    </p>

    <p>To teach myself web development I am using <strong>The Odin Project.
    </strong> I will be attempting to learn the MERN stack, which is Mongo.DB, 
    Express, React, and Node. I can't wait to see where I'll be in a year!</p>
